<h2>LSLi Site Static Replication</h2>


A core structural site with pages:
<ul>
<li>Homepage - index.php </li>
<li>property search list view - /pages/search_results.php </li>
<li>property search grid view - /pages/search_results_grid.php</li>
<li>Property - /pages/property.php</li>
</ul>

Sites replcated are JNP and Goodfellows. Add _jnp or _gf to url (e.g. property_gf.php) to see a site with brand colours.

An experimental branch is being used to create animation for the site. In this branch use index_exp.php.
On this page there is an animated confetti effect background, a static confetti overlay will be added to the image too.

A parallax effect is used for the header image.

A scrolling JavaScript (Sal.js) effect is for a animated text widget. This widget has a rotating hover effect too.
